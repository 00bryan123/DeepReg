**DeepReg is a freely available, community-supported open-source toolkit for research in
medical image registration using deep learning.**

The current version is implemented as a Tensorflow 2-based framework, and contains
implementations for unsupervised- and weaky-supervised algorithms with their
combinations and variants. `DeepReg` has a practical focus on growing and diverse
clinical applications, as seen in the provided [examples](./docs/tutorial_demo.md). Read
the [documentation and the tutorials](https://deepregnet.github.io/DeepReg/#/) for more
details.

_Right now, `DeepReg` is still under-development - however, many tutorials, demos and
much of the core funtionality are already accessible._

[Get involved](./docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) and help make `DeepReg` better!

## Features

DeepReg **extends and simplifies workflows for medical imaging researchers** working in
Tensorflow 2, and can be easily installed and used across multiple platforms for **rapid
deployment of deep-learning algorithms**.

DeepReg is designed to be used with **minimal programming or scripting**, owing to its
built-in command line tools.

Our development and all related work involved in the project is public, and **released
under the Apache 2.0 license**.

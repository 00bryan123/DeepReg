**DeepReg is a freely available, community-supported open-source toolkit for research
and education in medical image registration using deep learning.**

- TensorFlow-2-based for efficient training and rapid deployment;
- Implementing major unsupervised and weakly-supervised algorithms, with their
  combinations and variants;
- Focusing on growing and diverse clinical applications, with all DeepReg Demos using
  open-accessible data;
- Simple built-in command line tools requiring minimal programming and scripting;
- Open, permissible and research-and-education-driven, under the Apache 2.0 license.

## Contributing

Get involved, and help make DeepReg better! We want your help - **Really**.

**Being a contributor doesn't just mean writing code.** Equally important to
the open-source process is writing or proof-reading documentation, suggesting
or implementing tests, or giving feedback about the project. You might see
the errors and assumptions that have been glossed over. If you can write any
code at all, you can contribute code to open-source. We are constantly trying
out new skills, making mistakes, and learning from those mistakes.
That's how we all improve, and we are happy to help others learn with us.

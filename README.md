**DeepReg is a freely available, community-supported open-source toolkit for research
and education in medical image registration using deep learning.**

- TensorFlow2-based for efficient training and rapid deployment;
- Implementing major unsupervised and weakly-supervised algorithms, with their
  combinations and variants;
- Focusing on growing and diverse clinical applications, with all DeepReg Demos using
  open-accessible data;
- Simple built-in command line tools requiring minimal programming and scripting;
- Open, permissible and research-and-education-driven, under the Apache 2.0 license.

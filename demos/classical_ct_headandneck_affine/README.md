# Classical affine registration for head-and-neck CT images

This is a special demo that demonstrates using the DeepReg package for claissical image
registration, which iteratively solve an optimisation problem. Gradient descent is used
to minimise the image dissimilarity function of a given pair of moving anf fixed images.

## Instructions

- Run the demo_data.py script to download an example CT volumes with 21 labels;
- Run the demo_register.py script.

## Application

Although, in this demo, the moving images are simulated using a randomly generated
transformation. The registration technique can be used in radiotherapy to compensate the
difference between CT acquired at different time points, such as pre-treatment and
intra-treatment.

## Application

This demo aims to register pairs of brain MR and ultrasound scans. The dataset consists
of 22 subjects with low-grade brain gliomas who underwent brain tumour resection [1].
The main application for this type of registration is to better delineate brain tumour
boundaries during surgery and correct tissue shift induced by the craniotomy.

## Data

The dataset for this demo comes from Xiao et al. [1] and can be downloaded from:
https://archive.sigma2.no/pages/public/datasetDetail.jsf?id=10.11582/2020.00025.

## Instruction

Please install DeepReg following the [instructions](../getting_started/install.html) and
change the current directory to the root directory of DeepReg project, i.e. `DeepReg/`.

### Download data

Please execute the following command to download the data and pre-trained model. By
default, the downloaded data is only a partial of the original one. However the access
to the original data is temporarily unavailable.

```bash
python demos/paired_mrus_brain/demo_data.py
```

### Launch demo training

Please execute the following command to launch a demo training. The training logs will
be saved under `demos/paired_mrus_brain/logs_train`, where the saved checkpoints can be
used for prediction later.

```bash
python demos/paired_mrus_brain/demo_train.py
```

Here the training is launched using the GPU of index 0 with a limited number of steps
and reduced size. Please add flag `--no-test` to use the original training
configuration, such as

```bash
python demos/paired_mrus_brain/demo_train.py --no-test
```

Note: The number of epochs and reduced dataset size for training will result in a loss
in test accuracy so please train with the full dataset and for a greater number of
epochs for improved results.

### Launch prediction

Please execute the following command to launch the prediction with pre-trained model.
The prediction logs will be saved under `demos/paired_mrus_brain/logs_predict`, where
the visualization of predictions are saved. Check the
[CLI documentation](../docs/cli.html) for more details about prediction output.

```bash
python demos/paired_mrus_brain/demo_predict.py
```

Optionally, the user-trained model can be used by changing the `ckpt_path` variable
inside `demo_predict.py`. Note that the path should end with `.ckpt` and checkpoints are
saved under `logs_train` as mentioned above.

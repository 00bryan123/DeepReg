## Application

This is a demo targeting the alignment of hippocampal substructures (head and body)
using mono-modal MR images between different patients. The images are cropped around
those areas and manually annotated. This is a 3D intra-modal registration using a
composite loss of image and label similarity.

## Data

The dataset for this demo comes from the Learn2Reg MICCAI Challenge (Task 4) [1] and can
be downloaded from:
https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1RvJIjG2loU8uGkWzUuGjqVcGQW2RzNYA

## Instruction

### Installation

Please install DeepReg following the [instructions](../getting_started/install.html) and
change the current directory to the root directory of DeepReg project, i.e. `DeepReg/`.

### Download data

Please execute the following command to download and pre-process the data and
pre-trained model.

Pre-processing includes:

- Rescaling all images' intensity to 0-255.
- Creating and applying a binary mask to mask-out the padded values in images.
- Transforming label volumes using one-hot encoding (only for foreground classes)

```bash
python demos/unpaired_mr_brain/demo_data.py
```

### Launch demo training

Please execute the following command to launch a demo training. The training logs and
model checkpoints will be saved under `demos/unpaired_mr_brain/logs_train`.

```bash
python demos/unpaired_mr_brain/demo_train.py
```

Here the training is launched using the GPU of index 0 with a limited number of steps
and reduced size. Please add flag `--no-test` to use the original training
configuration, such as

```bash
python demos/unpaired_mr_brain/demo_train.py --no-test
```

### Launch prediction

Please execute the following command to launch the prediction with pre-trained model.
The prediction logs and visualization results will be saved under
`demos/unpaired_mr_brain/logs_predict`. Check the [CLI documentation](../docs/cli.html)
for more details about prediction output.

```bash
python demos/unpaired_mr_brain/demo_predict.py
```

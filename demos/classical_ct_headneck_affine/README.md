# Classical affine registration for head-and-neck CT images

This is a special demo that uses the DeepReg package for classical affine image
registration, which iteratively solves an optimisation problem. Gradient descent is used
to minimise the image dissimilarity function of a given pair of moving anf fixed images.

## Application

Although in this demo the moving images are simulated using a randomly generated
transformation. The registration technique can be used in radiotherapy to compensate the
difference between CT acquired at different time points, such as pre-treatment and
intra-/post-treatment.

## Data

Data is
[an example CT volume](https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/Public/Head-Neck-PET-CT)
with two labels.

## Instruction

### Installation

Please install DeepReg following the [instructions](../getting_started/install.html) and
change the current directory to the root directory of DeepReg project, i.e. `DeepReg/`.

### Download data

Please execute the following command to download and pre-process the data.

```bash
python demos/classical_ct_headneck_affine/demo_data.py
```

### Launch registration

Please execute the following command to register two images. The fixed image will be the
downloaded data and the moving image will be simulated by applying a random affine
transformation, such that the ground-truth is available for. The optimised
transformation will be applied to the moving images, as well as the moving labels. The
results, saved in a timestamped folder under the project directory, will compare the
warped image/labels with the ground-truth image/labels.

```bash
python demos/classical_ct_headneck_affine/demo_register.py
```
